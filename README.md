# 🧠 Building a Transformer Model from Scratch (GPT-style)

This project walks through the full pipeline of building and training a GPT-like transformer model from scratch — starting with a custom tokenizer, followed by a small transformer architecture, and finally training it on a subset of OpenWebText data.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is **not just to fine-tune an existing GPT model**, but to **understand and implement the entire process** behind how transformer models like GPT work — from tokenization to training to text generation.

This was done using a simplified architecture and smaller dataset, so output quality isn’t the main focus. Instead, the project is meant to help you:

- Learn how GPT-style models are trained from raw data.
- Build and customize your own tokenizer.
- Structure a transformer training workflow using PyTorch and HuggingFace.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Custom Tokenizer**: Built using Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) from raw text data.
- **Model Architecture**: A compact GPT-2-style model with 4 layers and 256-dimensional embeddings.
- **Training**: Performed chunk-by-chunk on tokenized data (~20 `.pt` chunks for demo).
- **Resume Support**: Training can resume from checkpoints (e.g., `checkpoint-56000`).
- **Generation**: Output is generated using the trained model and tokenizer.

## 🧪 Data & Personalization

> ⚠️ _If you're wondering why the generated text might feel generic... it's all in the data._

To make the model generate meaningful, context-aware outputs, **the dataset should reflect the kind of content you want the model to generate**. That could be:

- Your own writing (e.g., journals, text messages, blogs).
- Conversational data in your voice.
- Structured knowledge or domain-specific content.

This version was trained on a small chunked subset of OpenWebText — **just 20 training files out of a larger dataset**, for demonstration purposes.

**Bigger and more authentic data leads to better results.**
